      <description>A game about taking control over a ball and mastering friction to avoid a fatal outcome.
    The game was created in order to drive the development of the Pixleon Engine. Another important aspect of developing this game was to actually finish a game. Sounds easy but as it turns out, it is quite hard.
So would I consider the game finished? Not really, but it is playable and I aim to iterate on it until I can proudly present a 1.</description>

      <description>The Pixleon Engine is a game engine written in C++ with focus on 3D-games with physics.
The main motivation behind building it was to learn more about software development and game engine development in particular. For instance, I wanted to answer:
 How to decopuple different parts of a game engine? How to organize code into proper folders to help maintain decoupling? How to produce an interface from dlls that can be re-used in different games or interactive experiences?</description>
