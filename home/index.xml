      <description>Back in 2008 I started working at a company called Configura. Around ten years later I have learnt a lot and had the chance to work with some brilliant people.
Below is a list of some of the things I have been working on, either by myself or in a small team:
 Creating a scene graph API and graphics file format called CmSym. Integration of REDsdk in CET Designer. Creating an API to define high level materials.</description>
