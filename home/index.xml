      <description>Back in 2008 I started working at a company called Configura. More than ten years later I have learnt a lot and had the chance to work with some brilliant people.
Below is a list of some of the things I have been working on, either by myself or in a small team:
 Converting the material system for CET Designer to be PBR based (metal/roughness).  Developing an internal texture format to easily load different resolutions of the same texture.</description>
