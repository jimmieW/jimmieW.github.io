      <description>The Pixleon Engine is a game engine written in C++ with focus on 3D-games with physics.
The main motivation behind building it was to learn more about software development in general and game engine development in particular. For instance, I wanted to answer:
 How to decopuple different parts of a game engine? How to organize code into proper folders to help maintain decoupling? How to produce an interface from dlls that can be re-used in different games or interactive experiences?</description>
